    "Create Python program called `saluations.py` that will print a friendly greeting.\n",

    "## Installing new.py Into Your PATH\n",
    "\n",
    "I hate writing code from scratch! This week you learned about using a program called `new.py` that will create a program for you to start from. Now, we need to add this program to our PATH, so we can just use it without having to figure out where it is!\n",
    "\n",
    "In the _bin_ directory of your repo, you should find a program called `new.py` that will help you make a new Python program.\n",
    "From this directory, you can provide the full path using `..` to indicate the parent directory:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "cd ./assignments/01_salutations\n",

    "It will be unpleasant to always indicate the full path to `new.py` as you will use it often.\n",
    "I suggest you create a directory in your `$HOME` (which is often written using the tilde `~` AKA \"twiddle\") to put useful programs you'll write.\n",
    "It's common to create a _~/local_ or _~/.local_ (so it's hidden) to install software, and inside of that a _bin_ directory:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "mkdir ~/.local\n",
    "mkdir ~/.local/bin\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You will need to ensure that this directory is included in your `$PATH`. First check what Unix shell you are using:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "echo $SHELL\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "If are using the `bash` shell, you can edit _~/.bashrc_. If are using the `zsh` shell, you can edit _~/.zshrc_. \n",
    "For instance, you can use `nano`:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "nano ~/.bashrc\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Add this line to the end:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "export PATH=~/.local/bin:$PATH\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Then use the `source` command to read this file and alter your `$PATH`:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "source ~/.bashrc\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You can view your `$PATH` to ensure this directory is included:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "echo $PATH\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Then you can copy the `new.py` program to that location:\n",
    "\n",

    "cp ../../bin/new.py ~/.local/bin\n",
    "```\n",

    "## Getting Started with new.py\n",

    "* `-n|--name`: A name to greeting, defaults to \"Stranger\"\n",
    "* `-e|--excited`: A flag to terminate the greeting with an exclamation point\n",
    "\n",
    "The program should respond to `-h|--help` to print the following usage:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "$ ./salutations.py -h\n",
    "usage: salutations.py [-h] [-g str] [-n str] [-e]\n",

    "  -n str, --name str    Whom to greet (default: Stranger)\n",
    "  -e, --excited         Include an exclamation point (default: False)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "When run with no arguments, it should use the default values to print the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "$ ./salutations.py\n",
    "Howdy, Stranger.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The `-g|--greeting` option should cause it to use the provided greeting:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "$ ./salutations.py -g Sup\n",
    "Sup, Stranger.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The `-n|--name` option should cause it to use the provided name:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "$ ./salutations.py -n Amanda\n",
    "Howdy, Amanda.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "$ ./salutations.py -e\n",
    "Howdy, Stranger!\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The program should accept any combination of the short or long names of the arguments:\n",
    "\n",
